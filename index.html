    <h2>Text general</h2>
    <h4>This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves bef ore it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
      to make the world's books discoverable online. 
      
      It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
      to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
      are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that 's often difficult to discover. 
      
      Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
      publisher to a library and finally to you. 
      
      Usage guidelines 
      
      Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
      public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
      prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 
      
      We also ask that you: 
      
      + Make non- commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
      personal, non-commercial purposes.  "</h4>
